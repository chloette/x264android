{"name":"X264android","tagline":"base for X","body":"x264android\r\n===========\r\n(x264 README is listed below)\r\nx264android is a source project for Android NDK, which contains latest X264 codecs, and **ANDROID-USE-ONLY libraries compiled with x264 encoders**\r\n\r\n***Please make sure, before you follow \"How to xxx\" below, you already knew what's `ndk-build`, `environment-variable` and similar basic technologies.***\r\n\r\n##How to use\r\n1. Download [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html)\r\n2. Put the whole `x264/*` folder (actually, only `x264/android/*` folder should be enough.) under `$NDK/sources/x264/`\r\n3. Add reference `$(call import-module, x264/android/arm)` into Android.mk of your NDK project.\r\n4. Now ndk-build should work. Tada~\r\n\r\n##How to compile static libraries (DEFAULT) (BE CARE : LGPL limitation)\r\n1. Add path of ndk10 as environment variable : `$NDK10`\r\n2. Now you can copy `build_android.sh` into x264 folder and run it to compile. ***Tada~***\r\n\r\n##How to compile shared libraries\r\n1. Follow step 1 and 2 of \"How to compile (shared libraries)\"\r\n2. Use `--enable-shared` instead of `--enable-static` in `build_android.sh`\r\n3. Now you can run `build_android.sh` to compile shared libraries. ***Tada~***\r\n4. One more thing, modify `Android.mk`, use `PREBUILT_SHARED_LIBRARY` instead of `PREBUILT_STATIC_LIBRARY`; And use `lib***.so` instead of `lib***.a`\r\n\r\nBTW, If want to compile into ffmpeg, please use [@ffmpeg4android](https://github.com/chloette/ffmpeg4android) directly.\r\n\r\n##Environment\r\n***Android NDK*** only. T_T\r\n\r\n##License\r\nShould be same as x264...\r\n\r\n##Contact\r\nAny problems please contact me [@x264](https://github.com/chloette/x264android) or `chloette.e@gmail.com`\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##x264\r\n>x264 is a free software library and application for encoding video streams into the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC compression format, and is released under the terms of the ***GNU GPL***.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
